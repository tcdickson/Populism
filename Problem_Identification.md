## Problem Identification

- Political discourse is increasingly influenced by **populist rhetoric**.  
- There is a **resource gap**: few tools exist to identify, classify, and analyze populist sentiment at scale.  
- Such tools could help **analysts and policymakers** better understand trends and inform decisions.  
- To address this, I built an **AIP workflow** that:  
  - Detects and classifies populist rhetoric in large datasets.  
  - Provides an **interactive dashboard** for exploration and analysis.  
  - Is **reusable and adaptable** to study other rhetorical styles or ideologies.  
  - Integrates with Hugging Face models to generate **neutral comparison summaries**.
